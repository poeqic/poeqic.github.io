{"name":"QIC","tagline":"Quasi-In-Chat Search for Path of Exile","body":"# QIC\r\nQuasi-In-Chat Search\r\n\r\nQIC is trade search tool (as of 0.2) that aims to allow Path of Exile players to have an in-game item search tool. It features searching by search terms (or terms) like \"50life 60res 4L boots\".\r\n\r\nIt monitors the Path of Exile client log file for commands typed in-game and uses AHK to display an On-Screen Display (OSD). Commands can be extended or modified via .txt files in terms directory. Commands work when typed in all Chat Channels except the following: \"Global\", \"Trade\", \"Whisper\". This is subject to changes.  \r\n\r\n[Go to screenshots.](#screenshots)\r\n\r\n# Commands\r\n\r\n* `search` or `s` `{search terms}` - runs a search given _search term_.\r\n  * _Example_: `s gloves 80life 90eleres`\r\n* `searchend` or `se` - closes the search result window.\r\n* `reload` - reloads overlay_config.ini and the GUI.\r\n* `searchexit` or `sexit` - stops QIC.
